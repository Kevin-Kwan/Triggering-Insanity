# About
The files in this repository contain a video game made using Greenfoot/Java for Kevin's CSA Project at GSMST during the 2019-2020 junior school year. My CSA Teacher was Mr. Kevin Hare. My code is intentioned to be CLOSED SOURCE, but I guess if you can understand what I've done to get the game working, I guess it's technically open source lol. Good luck trying to figure out what everything does! The game is technically incomplete because there should be a lot more levels created, but the game is sufficient for now.
