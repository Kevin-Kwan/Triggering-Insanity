# About
The files in this repository contain a video game made using Greenfoot/Java for Kevin's CSA Project at GSMST during the 2019-2020 junior school year. My CSA Teacher was Mr. Kevin Hare. My code is intentioned to be CLOSED SOURCE. Please read and abide by the LICENSE and scroll down below for gameplay preview and showcase in a video format. The game is technically incomplete because there should be a lot more levels created, but the game is sufficient for now.
